# Troubles Log

## 1. RDKit usage inside Spark
**Problem:**  
RDKit is a Python library and cannot be used directly in Spark expressions. I had to install it with jupyter notebook expression `%pip install rdkit`

## 2. Databricks overall usage
**Problem:**
Not a real problem but it was my first time using Databricks and Spark. I tried my best to find the best solutions and make code more reliable and readable.
